# Context
- Services vs libraries
- npm init
- The src folder

# Folders
- entry - practically access from 2 sources, the serverless example
- domain - the unique code, change only here, more testable
- data-access - isolate the reusable
- Where would you put calls to 3rd party?

# Build API 
- index.js
- API file, import stuff, create routes
- Middlewares - create one inline, move to lib
