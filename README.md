# Welcome To My Node.JS Course!
This repository holds various materials, demos and instructions for my Node.JS course


## Preparation
As we meet in the classroom we wish to spend our precious time on interesting development challenges rather than machine setup. Make sure to prepare your machine aforehand. Should you encounter any issue - please open an issue within this repo and I'll be sure to assist shortly

### ✔ 1 Install Node.JS v8.9.x
Install Node.JS LTS (any 8.9.X version) [from this website](https://nodejs.org/en/) - just download and progress within the installation wizard

### ✔ 2 Ensure Node is installed correctly
Open your favourite terminal (Windows: command prompt) and type 'NPM verson'. The output should confirm that version 8.9.x is indeed installed

### ✔ 3 Install IDE (editor)
I highly recommend using VSCode editor in the course as it's lightweight and has a very rich plugins eco-sysem that we might use during our excercise. Simply visit the [downloads site](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and choose the edition that suits your operations system. You may opt for any other editor that supports Node debugging and intellisense

### ✔ 4 Install The following NPM packages
Most of our excercises rely on few popular backbone packages that we can install aforehand. Open your terminal (Windows: command prompt) and paste the following command:
```
npm install express mocha nyc nodemon faker eslint eslint-plugin-node passport jsonschema jsonwebtoken knex socket.io
```

## Code Examples
All the code examples that we run in the classroom [can be found in this Git repository](https://github.com/i0natan/nodebestpractices/tree/course)
